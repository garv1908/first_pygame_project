# My first project with pygame!

## What exactly is this?

The python script named "pygame_test.py" contains the code for the entire running for the game. The game is essentially the concept of _Snake_ but if it was played by a _Circle_ instead!
There is a point system, and audio files that play for certain achievements with those points. Didn't mess around with audio volumes so stay careful!

## Why I made this:

I've always seen people on YouTube use pygame for GameJams! I recently attended a hackathon event and was amazed by the amount of progress I can make just messing around with things alone, giving rise to my desire to learn something new! GameJams were similar in a sense and I've always wanted to gain an understanding with pygame, so I started messing around with it.

I just wanted to mess around with the creation of a screen, and eventually fell into the rabbithole of making something _real_ out of it.
